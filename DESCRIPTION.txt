KeyWord BookMarks enables the user to navigate to frequently used sites using only the keyboard.

How To:
• Go to a website. (e.g. http://example.com)
• Bookmark a website. (Ctrl-D)
• Prefix the title with a short name (keyword) in square brackets. (At the far left of the 'Name' field type '[ex]', click 'Done'.)
• Select the omnibox. (Ctrl-L)
• Type 'kw{tab}ex{enter}'.  (Voila: You have arrived at http://example.com)

As an additional feature, a suffix may be added to the keyword.
• ':p' : Pin the tab after opening bookmark.
• ':t' : Open the bookmark in a new tab.
• ':w' : Open the bookmark in a new window.
• ':wi' : Open the bookmark in a new incognito window.

This is an updated version of a very old extension: Bookmark Keyword (https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bookmark-keyword/jgmmhndnlacimnjmgplphnokhnlbhnmd)

This extension is used every day by the author.

"Nothing done every day should require the mouse."
